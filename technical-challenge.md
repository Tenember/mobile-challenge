Start of the technical challenge for the regroop app.

The following will be a documentation to trace the start time and include any necessary feedbacks.

- Start Monday 17, April 2023 at 3:30pm
- Made expo to finally work through my Public Network
- Real start at 4pm


Feedbacks on the difficulties encountered :

- Fullscreen videos in a scrollview does not seems to be used a lot, had to search google a lot to find why my scroll view did not shows my videos. Had to dynamically get the screen width from `Dimensions`.
- Took a little time to figure out how to start and pause the video when in viewport. Tried using the `refs` and tried a solution way too much complex, went back to a simpler solution.
